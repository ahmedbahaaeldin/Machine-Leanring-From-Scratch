# Machine-Leanring-From-Scratch
The purpose of this repository is to practice the understandings of different algorithms and to help others understand what is the blackbox made of. 

# Models:-
## 1-Support Vector Machine 

Tested on some random points as a proof of concept.

## 2-Logitistic Regression 

## 3- K-Means (In progress)

## 4-Vanilla Neural Network 

Vanilla Neural Network with Tanh activation function and Softmax with cross entropy for final layer.
Tested on MNIST dataset with 3 hidden layers and the layers dimensions are : Layer 1 (784,128) - Layer 2 (128,128) - Layer 3 (128,10). 
Achieved Testing accuracy : 80.61% with 2000 epochs

## 5-Recurrent Neural Network (In progress)

## 6- Long Short Term Memory (In progress)
